# My Thrill Ride Tracker Web Application  
I wanted to create an responsive web application that my son and I could use to track all of the amusement parks we visit and rate them as well as the park rides for each visit. I decided to use ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC and SQL Server with a little Javascript and Ajax mixed in for the dropdowns and images.  

Following this training on MS Docs: [Create a web app with ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-3.1)  
## Release Notes
- 1/8/21 Had to install and use **EF Core 3.0.3**, 3.1.10 and 5.0.1 EF Core broke DbContext and DbContextOptions
